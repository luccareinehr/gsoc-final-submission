# Google Summer of Code '22
Final submission for Google Summer of Code '22 at [@chipsalliance](github.com/chipsalliance/) ðŸ¤–

## Introduction
For this last Summer and the month of October, I've been working on an open silicon project in the Google Summer of Code program as part of CHIPS Alliance, an umbrella organization hosted by The Linux Foundation. The project is **OpenFASoC**, conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan. With this text, I would like to share what I've contributed to, and how the experience has been in this journey.

## Summary
OpenFASoC, an acronym for "Fully Open-Source Autonomous SoC Synthesis using Customizable Cell-Based Synthesizable Analog Circuits", is a somewhat recent piece of software that  aims to, given user specifications, automatically generate physical circuit blocks that can be later used in integrated circuits. The project scope is mainly focused on analog and mixed-signal designs. Currently, only six designs are at work, with more to come in the future.

I've worked mainly with one of the designs, a small subthreshold temperature sensor - or, in fact, the module that builds it: the temperature sensor generator (`temp-sense-gen`). My initial proposal was to create a Design Space Exploration (DSE) infrastructure to optimize this generator and automatically choose the best configuration for its internal generator parameters, such as the circuit's physical design generation variables, to keep them as default regardless of user specs. However, due to the complexity of the domain - I'm an EE student at CentraleSupÃ©lec, but still undergraduate - me and my mentor, prof. Mehdi Saligane, chose to change the goal to rather improve the current temperature sensor design generation, and at the end propose an opening for a future DSE project.

## Working environment

The team working on OpenFASoC consists of researchers from UMich, professionals of the industry committed to open source software and a few students from different parts of the world, with my mentor being the lead. Communication was done by Slack and meetings were organized twice a week, with meeting hours being a minor inconvenience in such an international team. In fact, this characteristic of the project was one of the most enriching to me, as I could obtain an experience of working with people from different backgrounds, that communicate in different ways, and in a remote setting which is becoming more and more common.

This project was set as of long duration (~300 hours), with an agreed extended deadline of October 24th.

## Tools

Regarding development, in this project I mainly used:

- OpenROAD 
- OpenROAD Flow Scripts

To some extent, these tools were also used:

- KLayout
- Netgen
- Magic

In terms of programming languages, it mainly required:

- Python: for reading and writing scripts
- Tcl: for writing scripts to control the physical design generation flow

Other languages, used less frequently, were:

- C++: to read and debug OpenROAD code
- Verilog: to understand how the circuit description files are modified by the generator

There was also exposure to some types of files common in electronics physical design software, mainly:

- SPICE files: to debug simulation and LVS files
- DEF/LEF files: for describing and debugging the physical layout

## My contributions

We can devide the work done in three timeframes:

### First phase (June - July)

Being a fairly new repository (it was created in March 2021), OpenFASoC still doesn't have some of the features that mature projects do, which posed added difficulties during GSoC. Here are some of them:

- Lack of documentation
- Dependencies are very unstable and update often
- Project structure can change frequently
- The tool is not yet packaged
- There's no release schedule
- Installation is done all manually

These were major challenges at the start of the program, and while some have been addressed during GSoC (such as added installation options and documentation), they remain as difficulties to new contributors that will definitely get sorted as the project grows.

Because of this, the first weeks were dedicated to familiarizing with the tools that the project used and tackling small issues. Main points were:

- Ease the installation of dependencies by using Conda packages
- Experiments with the working generators
- Study of the integrated circuit design flow

### Second phase (August - Sept)

The month of August used to tackle a major dependency problem for the temperature sensor generator: the update of its flow scripts to the latest version of the OpenROAD tool. OpenROAD is an open source software that allows for the generation of physical circuit layouts from Verilog descriptions, so it is crucial to most generators in OpenFASoC. When updating it, I tried to change the OpenFASoC flow slightly to keep it as close to OpenROAD Flow Scripts as possible, to make it easy to update in the future since ours was a fork of it. This change would make it possible to later add punctual improvements to the generator in the third phase.

As a consequence, main points were:

- Study of the OpenROAD RTL-to-GDS tool
- Update the temperature sensor generator to use the latest version of OpenROAD ([pull request #82](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/pull/82))
- Organize generated artifacts
- Restructure docs and document the temperature sensor generator flow ([pull request #100](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/pull/100))

### Third phase (Sept - Oct)

During the third phase,

<!-- how the team is structured

Being a new repo,
lack of documentation
structure that can change frequently
dependencies are very unstable
the tool is not yet packaged
there's no release schedule
installation is all manual


conclusion:

allowed me to work with people from all over the world (the US, India, Morocco, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Japan
